# Sorting_visualizer
This application is used to visualize various sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc and performs
the operations of algorithms step by step.
It allows the users to select the sort algorithm and the speed of the visualization.
SORTING-VISUALIZER is for the ones who want to see these algorithms under a different light and hopefully appreciate the processing and brain power behind these pieces of genius that in many ways have changed the way we live.
